  <p align="center">
    A simple chess app begginning my hobby of chess programming.

### Built With

* python
* pygame



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Download the zip, unpack, and run the main. Any of the popular sites for playing will be a better experience, this was merely a project for me to explore chess with my limited coding experience.




<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

-  Move clocks
-  Move log
-  Material count


<!-- MY EXPERIENCE -->
## Take Aways
When I first started this project, it seemed overwhelming. But I was able to break everything down into managable parts, and this is something that I can take with me to all of my future projects. 

I started by simply drawing the board, and returning a square on click. That was actually more difficult than any of the other things I did, because that task reuired the most learning from pygame. But once I finished the board, everything else seemed much easier as I was focusing on how the rules of the game would translate into code, the exercise I was excited about. I took away that it's harder to get the ball rolling than to keep it going.

### Was I successful?
I would say so-so. I succeeded in my goals, but I know that I constructed this project inefficiently, and there's plenty of room for optimization, especially if I want to learn about constructing an engine.

### What's Next for Future Chess Projects
1. Code optimization
2. Learning how to capture a game state
3. Generating random moves
4. Creating a metric for evaluating a valuable game state
5. Creating new, original, fun chess variants such as horde chess
